  "aboutProject": "This RAG system provides comprehensive environmental, energy, and demographic data for districts across the Arequipa region of Peru. The system contains detailed measurements from multiple datasets including nighttime lights intensity, solar energy potential, solar installation details, and population density from the 2025 census. Users can query specific districts, compare environmental indicators across provinces, understand energy potential, analyze development patterns, and examine demographic distributions. The data covers districts across 8 provinces (Arequipa, Camaná, Caravelí, Castilla, Caylloma, Condesuyos, Islay, La Unión) with detailed information on nighttime lights, solar irradiation potential, existing solar infrastructure, and population density. Each district entry includes coordinates, environmental measurements, energy potential data, infrastructure details, and demographic statistics."
