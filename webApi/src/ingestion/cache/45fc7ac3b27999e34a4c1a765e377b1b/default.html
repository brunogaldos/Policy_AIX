<p dir="ltr">“Of the myriad applications of artificial intelligence (AI), its use in humanitarian assistance is underappreciated. In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Togo’s government used AI tools to identify tens of thousands of households that needed money to buy food, as Nature reports in a News Feature this week. Typically, potential recipients of such payments would be identified when they apply for welfare schemes, or through household surveys of income and expenditure. But such surveys were not possible during the pandemic, and the authorities needed to find alternative means to help those in need. Researchers used machine learning to comb through satellite imagery of low-income areas and combined that knowledge with data from mobile-phone networks to find eligible recipients, who then received a regular payment through their phones. Using AI tools in this way was a game-changer for the country.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">“Coracle, a company which provides secure laptops to prisoners in the UK, is working with the University of Hertfordshire to develop an AI assistant that will tailor courses to the learning styles of individual inmates. Coracle’s founder, James Tweed, says the project can help plug the skills shortage and get ex-offenders in steadier jobs once they leave prison. ‘The prison system can be likened to the public service of last resort,’ says Tweed. ‘Individuals fall through the system – maybe they’ve been through care, they’ve fallen out of school, they might have mental health issues and educational issues – but all services have failed at some point. So they’ve ended up in prison.’ Coracle’s educational devices are used in 91 of the 123 prisons in the UK and it currently partners with 60 content providers, including the Open University, Prisoners’ Education Trust and a range of vocational programmes.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">Podcast: “Africa’s healthcare systems face major challenges, from workforce shortages to gaps in infrastructure. In the latest episode of Africa Science Focus, reporter Michael Kaloki speaks with AI experts about how Artificial Intelligence (AI) is driving change across the continent. Charles Waka explains how AI is optimising maternal and neonatal healthcare, improving outcomes for mothers and newborns. Ndisha Mwakala, a former health information systems advisor at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, discusses how limited African data was a major hurdle in developing an AI tool to identify patients most at risk of HIV and connect them to testing and treatment. Zakia Salod, South African researcher in medical AI and bioinformatics, highlights how AI-powered tools like her VAXIN8 are accelerating vaccine development. Darlington Akogo, CEO of minoHealth AI Labs, discusses how his AI tool, Moremi, streamlines disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and prescription, while Uzma Alam, programme lead for science policy engagement at the Science for Africa Foundation, stresses the need for investment in AI research to maximise its benefits.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">“With the rapid advance of large language models, AI chatbots are quickly becoming go-to sources of information on everything from politics to natural disasters to public health. While traditional search engines overwhelm us with information that may be relevant to our questions, chatbots “give us an answer.” But that answer may not always be correct. Despite significant breakthroughs, AI chatbots still regularly offer answers that are biased or flat-out wrong…</p>
<p dir="ltr">Right now, relying on an AI chatbot for information about one’s sexual or reproductive health is uniquely risky. Inaccurate or irrelevant responses can lead a person to put their own health in jeopardy, and responses that are insensitive to cultural or linguistic norms can drive users away entirely. This is why Meedan’s research team has set out to build standards for public health chatbots that will help address emergent health needs by taking a safe, inclusive, multilingual approach that will consider the unique challenges faced by healthcare workers and patients in crisis settings.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">“Between September and January, six Google Pixel smartphones hitched free rides on four New York City subway cars. Specifically, they took the A train, as it ping-ponged the 32 miles between the northern tip of Manhattan and the southern reaches of Queens…The phones were part of a brief experiment by New York City’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority and Google into whether cheap, mostly off-the-shelf technology could supplement the agency’s track inspection work. (Google Public Sector, the division that undertook the work, didn’t charge the MTA for this initial experiment.) Today, inspections are carried out by human inspectors, who together walk all 665 miles of New York City’s subway tracks, eyes peeled for problems like broken rails, busted signals, and water damage. Thrice-annual rides by specialized, sensor-laden ‘train geometry cars,’ also capture and upload more sophisticated data on the status of the city’s rail infrastructure.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">“What if we could build a civil service from the ground up with AI at its core? This conversation between Audrey Tang and Apolitical CEO Robyn Scott explores what that could look like — how AI can assist rather than replace, how citizen participation can scale through AI-enabled deliberation and how trust anchors like academic institutions can stabilise governance in a polarised world. Along the way, they touch on humour as a tool for governance, the role of open-source safety measures and why The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy offers lessons for AI policy. As governments adopt AI, the goal isn’t to replace civil servants — it’s to make their work more effective, responsive, and human.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">Legal article about how courts can protect individuals’ right to due process when government agencies use AI systems to aid their decision making: “In this Article, I argue that the use of AI can be compatible with procedural due process. It is a choice to adopt AI that violates due process rights, just like it is a choice to send unintelligible notice or conduct unfair administrative hearings in a way that violates people’s due process rights. As a design matter, AI systems that provide notice and an opportunity to contest them are not only feasible, but a mature body of computer science research has shown that these interpretable or glass box systems perform as well—or they perform better—than black box AI systems. If AI is designed to be interpretable, or a glass box, then people can be on notice of not just the fact that AI was used, but what factors it relied on. They can then meaningfully challenge decisions made using AI. Violating due process is a design choice, and a poor one. And interpretable AI can be compatible with due process protections. Existing due process protections can protect us, but only if judges or lawmakers rigorously insist on validated, reliable and interpretable AI to protect due process.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">“In an ever-changing, tech-driven world, artificial intelligence systems are becoming increasingly pervasive each year. At the same time, lawmakers across the country and in Connecticut are looking to legislation as a way to regulate it, especially in the health care field. One such bill, proposed by state Sen. Saud Anwar, D-South Windsor, aims to amend the state's code to prohibit health insurance carriers from using AI to determine patient care ‘to safeguard patient access to testing, medications and procedures.’ He said the bill comes after a ProPublica investigation found how Connecticut-based Cigna Insurance was refusing care to patients with the help of AI-guided algorithms during the prior authorization process.”</p>

Under the bill, people who post such content would face penalties and prison time. The FTC could sue tech companies for not complying as an unfair or deceptive act or practice, Curi writes…The bill is sponsored by Sen.

<p dir="ltr">“Artificial intelligence (AI) workers in Kenya have launched the Data Labelers Association (DLA) to fight for fair pay, mental health support and better overall working conditions. Employed to train and maintain the AI systems of major technology companies, the data labellers and annotators say they formed the DLA to challenge the “systemic injustices” they face in the workplace, with 339 members joining the organisation in its first week. While the popular perception of AI revolves around the idea of an autodidactic machine that can act and learn with complete autonomy, the reality is that the technology requires a significant amount of human labour to complete even the most basic functions. Otherwise known as ghost, micro or click work, this labour is used to train and assure AI algorithms by disseminating the discrete tasks that make up the AI development pipeline to a globally distributed pool of workers. Despite Kenya becoming a major hub for AI-related labour, the DLA said data workers are massively underpaid – often earning just cents for tasks that take a number of hours to complete – and yet still face frequent pay disputes over withheld wages that are never resolved.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">“For all the talk about artificial intelligence upending the world, its economic effects remain uncertain. But Institute Professor and 2024 Nobel winner Daron Acemoglu has some insights.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Despite some predictions that AI will double US GDP growth, Acemoglu expects it to increase GDP by 1.1% to 1.6% over the next 10 years, with a roughly 0.05% annual gain in productivity. This assessment is based on recent estimates of how many jobs are affected—but his view is that the effect will be targeted. ‘We’re still going to have journalists, we’re still going to have financial analysts, we’re still going to have HR employees,’ he says. ‘It’s going to impact a bunch of office jobs that are about data summary, visual matching, pattern recognition, etc. And those are essentially about 5% of the economy.’”</p>

The effort, in collaboration with Research Improving People’s Lives (RIPL), a national nonprofit that helps governments harness data, is described in the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) Combined State Plan for 2024-27. LAUNCH, it said, offers integrated service delivery to ‘support all residents on pathways to employment and economic security.’ It utilizes the ‘no wrong door’ philosophy enabling a single point of entry into a website or system, and uses data and artificial intelligence to match job seekers with postings and suggest learning resources.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">“One of the most prescient scholars of policing and technology, Andrew Guthrie Ferguson’s recent paper, Generative Suspicion and the Risks of AI-Assisted Police Reports, offers a fascinating overview of AI-generated police reports and the potential impact on criminal practice. Police reports might seem like dull bureaucratic minutiae. But a police report can shape a person’s fate, from whether and what charges get filed, to the plea deal that is offered, and the sentence a defendant receives. One of the first items in a criminal case for a prosecutor or defense attorney to review, the police report shapes and constrains the narrative. The report defines victims and perpetrators, provides potential impeachment material for trial, and impacts the availability of defenses. The transformation of how police reports are generated is thus important, with potential systemic impacts.”</p>
